## Introduction

This tutorial tries to help newcomers to cats-effect to get familiar with its
main concepts by means of code examples, in a learn-by-doing fashion. Two small
programs will be coded, each one in its own section. [The first
one](#copyingfiles) copies the contents from one file to another, safely
handling _resources_ and _cancellation_ in the process. That should help us to
flex our muscles. [The second one](#producerconsumer) implements a solution to
the producer-consumer problem to introduce cats-effect _fibers_.

This tutorial assumes certain familiarity with functional programming. It is
also a good idea to read cats-effect documentation prior to starting this
tutorial, at least the 
[excellent documentation about `IO` data type](../datatypes/io.md).

Please read this tutorial as training material, not as a best-practices
document. As you gain more experience with cats-effect, probably you will find
your own solutions to deal with the problems presented here. Also, bear in mind
that using cats-effect for copying files or implementing basic concurrency
patterns (such as the producer-consumer problem) is suitable for a 'getting
things done' approach, but for more complex systems/settings/requirements you
might want to take a look at [fs2](http://fs2.io) or [Monix](https://monix.io)
to find powerful network and file abstractions that integrate with cats-effect.
But that is beyond the purpose of this tutorial, which focuses solely on
cats-effect.

That said, let's go!

## Setting things up

This [Github repo](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial) includes all
the software that will be developed during this tutorial. It uses `sbt` as the
build tool. To ease coding, compiling and running the code snippets in this
tutorial it is recommended to use the same `build.sbt`, or at least one with the
same dependencies and compilation options:

```scala
name := "cats-effect-tutorial"

version := "2.2.0"

scalaVersion := "2.12.8"

libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "2.2.0" withSources() withJavadoc()

scalacOptions ++= Seq(
  "-feature",
  "-deprecation",
  "-unchecked",
  "-language:postfixOps",
  "-language:higherKinds",
  "-Ypartial-unification")
```

Code snippets in this tutorial can be pasted and compiled right in the scala
console of the project defined above (or any project with similar settings).

## <a name="copyingfiles"></a>Copying files - basic concepts, resource handling and cancellation

Our goal is to create a program that copies files. First we will work on a
function that carries such task, and then we will create a program that can be
invoked from the shell and uses that function.

First of all we must code the function that copies the content from a file to
another file. The function takes the source and destination files as parameters.
But this is functional programming! So invoking the function shall not copy
anything, instead it will return an [`IO`](../datatypes/io.md) instance that
encapsulates all the side effects involved (opening/closing files,
reading/writing content), that way _purity_ is kept.  Only when that `IO`
instance is evaluated all those side-effectful actions will be run. In our
implementation the `IO` instance will return the amount of bytes copied upon
execution, but this is just a design decision. Of course errors can occur, but
when working with any `IO` those should be embedded in the `IO` instance. That
is, no exception is raised outside the `IO` and so no `try` (or the like) needs
to be used when using the function, instead the `IO` evaluation will fail and
the `IO` instance will carry the error raised.

Now, the signature of our function looks like this:

```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import java.io.File

def copy(origin: File, destination: File): IO[Long] = ???
```

Nothing scary, uh? As we said before, the function just returns an `IO`
instance. When run, all side-effects will be actually executed and the `IO`
instance will return the bytes copied in a `Long` (note that `IO` is
parameterized by the return type). Now, let's start implementing our function.
First, we need to open two streams that will read and write file contents.

### Acquiring and releasing `Resource`s
We consider opening a stream to be a side-effect action, so we have to
encapsulate those actions in their own `IO` instances. For this, we will make
use of cats-effect [`Resource`](../datatypes/resource.md), that allows to
orderly create, use and then release resources. See this code:

```scala
import cats.effect.{IO, Resource}
import cats.syntax.all._ 
import java.io._ 

def inputStream(f: File): Resource[IO, FileInputStream] =
  Resource.make {
    IO(new FileInputStream(f))                         // build
  } { inStream =>
    IO(inStream.close()).handleErrorWith(_ => IO.unit) // release
  }

def outputStream(f: File): Resource[IO, FileOutputStream] =
  Resource.make {
    IO(new FileOutputStream(f))                         // build 
  } { outStream =>
    IO(outStream.close()).handleErrorWith(_ => IO.unit) // release
  }

def inputOutputStreams(in: File, out: File): Resource[IO, (InputStream, OutputStream)] =
  for {
    inStream  <- inputStream(in)
    outStream <- outputStream(out)
  } yield (inStream, outStream)
```

We want to ensure that streams are closed once we are done using them, no matter
what. That is precisely why we use `Resource` in both `inputStream` and
`outputStream` functions, each one returning one `Resource` that encapsulates
the actions for opening and then closing each stream.  `inputOutputStreams`
encapsulates both resources in a single `Resource` instance that will be
available once the creation of both streams has been successful, and only in
that case. As seen in the code above `Resource` instances can be combined in
for-comprehensions as they implement `flatMap`. Note also that when releasing
resources we must also take care of any possible error during the release
itself, for example with the `.handleErrorWith` call as we do in the code above.
In this case we just swallow the error, but normally it should be at least
logged.

Optionally we could have used `Resource.fromAutoCloseable` to define our
resources, that method creates `Resource` instances over objects that implement
`java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface without having to define how the resource is
released. So our `inputStream` function would look like this:

```scala
import cats.effect.{IO, Resource}
import java.io.{File, FileInputStream}

def inputStream(f: File): Resource[IO, FileInputStream] =
  Resource.fromAutoCloseable(IO(new FileInputStream(f)))
```

That code is way simpler, but with that code we would not have control over what
would happen if the closing operation throws an exception. Also it could be that
we want to be aware when closing operations are being run, for example using
logs. In contrast, using `Resource.make` allows to easily control the actions
of the release phase.

Let's go back to our `copy` function, which now looks like this:

```scala
import cats.effect.{IO, Resource}
import java.io._

// as defined before
def inputOutputStreams(in: File, out: File): Resource[IO, (InputStream, OutputStream)] = ???

// transfer will do the real work
def transfer(origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream): IO[Long] = ???

def copy(origin: File, destination: File): IO[Long] = 
  inputOutputStreams(origin, destination).use { case (in, out) => 
    transfer(in, out)
  }
```

The new method `transfer` will perform the actual copying of data, once the
resources (the streams) are obtained. When they are not needed anymore, whatever
the outcome of `transfer` (success or failure) both streams will be closed. If
any of the streams could not be obtained, then `transfer` will not be run. Even
better, because of `Resource` semantics, if there is any problem opening the
input file then the output file will not be opened.  On the other hand, if there
is any issue opening the output file, then the input stream will be closed.

### What about `bracket`?
Now, if you are familiar with cats-effect's
[`Bracket`](../typeclasses/bracket.md) you may be wondering why we are not using
it as it looks so similar to `Resource` (and there is a good reason for that:
`Resource` is based on `bracket`). Ok, before moving forward it is worth to take
a look to `bracket`.

There are three stages when using `bracket`: _resource acquisition_, _usage_,
and _release_. Each stage is defined by an `IO` instance.  A fundamental
property is that the _release_ stage will always be run regardless whether the
_usage_ stage finished correctly or an exception was thrown during its
execution. In our case, in the _acquisition_ stage we would create the streams,
then in the _usage_ stage we will copy the contents, and finally in the release
stage we will close the streams.  Thus we could define our `copy` function as
follows:

```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.syntax.all._ 
import java.io._ 

// function inputOutputStreams not needed

// transfer will do the real work
def transfer(origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream): IO[Long] = ???

def copy(origin: File, destination: File): IO[Long] = {
  val inIO: IO[InputStream]  = IO(new FileInputStream(origin))
  val outIO:IO[OutputStream] = IO(new FileOutputStream(destination))

  (inIO, outIO)              // Stage 1: Getting resources 
    .tupled                  // From (IO[InputStream], IO[OutputStream]) to IO[(InputStream, OutputStream)]
    .bracket{
      case (in, out) =>
        transfer(in, out)    // Stage 2: Using resources (for copying data, in this case)
    } {
      case (in, out) =>      // Stage 3: Freeing resources
        (IO(in.close()), IO(out.close()))
        .tupled              // From (IO[Unit], IO[Unit]) to IO[(Unit, Unit)]
        .handleErrorWith(_ => IO.unit).void
    }
}
```

New `copy` definition is more complex, even though the code as a whole is way
shorter as we do not need the `inputOutputStreams` function. But there is a
catch in the code above.  When using `bracket`, if there is a problem when
getting resources in the first stage, then the release stage will not be run.
Now, in the code above, first the origin file and then the destination file are
opened (`tupled` just reorganizes both `IO` instances into a single one). So
what would happen if we successfully open the origin file (_i.e._ when
evaluating `inIO`) but then an exception is raised when opening the destination
file (_i.e._ when evaluating `outIO`)? In that case the origin stream will not
be closed! To solve this we should first get the first stream with one `bracket`
call, and then the second stream with another `bracket` call inside the first.
But, in a way, that's precisely what we do when we `flatMap` instances of
`Resource`. And the code looks cleaner too. So, while using `bracket` directly
has its place, `Resource` is likely to be a better choice when dealing with
multiple resources at once.

### Copying data 
Finally we have our streams ready to go! We have to focus now on coding
`transfer`. That function will have to define a loop that at each iteration
reads data from the input stream into a buffer, and then writes the buffer
contents into the output stream. At the same time, the loop will keep a counter
of the bytes transferred. To reuse the same buffer we should define it outside
the main loop, and leave the actual transmission of data to another function
`transmit` that uses that loop. Something like:

```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.syntax.all._ 
import java.io._ 

def transmit(origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream, buffer: Array[Byte], acc: Long): IO[Long] =
  for {
    amount <- IO(origin.read(buffer, 0, buffer.size))
    count  <- if(amount > -1) IO(destination.write(buffer, 0, amount)) >> transmit(origin, destination, buffer, acc + amount)
              else IO.pure(acc) // End of read stream reached (by java.io.InputStream contract), nothing to write
  } yield count // Returns the actual amount of bytes transmitted

def transfer(origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream): IO[Long] =
  for {
    buffer <- IO(new Array[Byte](1024 * 10)) // Allocated only when the IO is evaluated
    total  <- transmit(origin, destination, buffer, 0L)
  } yield total
```

Take a look at `transmit`, observe that both input and output actions are
encapsulated in (suspended in) `IO`. `IO` being a monad, we can sequence them
using a for-comprehension to create another `IO`. The for-comprehension loops as
long as the call to `read()` does not return a negative value that would signal
that the end of the stream has been reached. `>>` is a Cats operator to sequence
two operations where the output of the first is not needed by the second (_i.e._
it is equivalent to `first.flatMap(_ => second)`). In the code above that means
that after each write operation we recursively call `transmit` again, but as
`IO` is stack safe we are not concerned about stack overflow issues. At each
iteration we increase the counter `acc` with the amount of bytes read at that
iteration. 

We are making progress, and already have a version of `copy` that can be used.
If any exception is raised when `transfer` is running, then the streams will be
automatically closed by `Resource`. But there is something else we have to take
into account: `IO` instances execution can be **_canceled!_**. And cancellation
should not be ignored, as it is a key feature of cats-effect. We will discuss
cancellation in the next section.

### Dealing with cancellation
Cancellation is a powerful but non-trivial cats-effect feature. In cats-effect,
some `IO` instances can be canceled ( _e.g._ by other `IO` instaces running
concurrently) meaning that their evaluation will be aborted. If the programmer is
careful, an alternative `IO` task will be run under cancellation, for example to
deal with potential cleaning up activities.

Now, `IO`s created with `Resource.use` can be canceled. The cancellation will
trigger the execution of the code that handles the closing of the resource. In
our case, that would close both streams. So far so good! But what happens if
cancellation happens _while_ the streams are being used? This could lead to data
corruption as a stream where some thread is writing to is at the same time being
closed by another thread. For more info about this problem see
[Gotcha: Cancellation is a concurrent action](../datatypes/io.md#gotcha-cancellation-is-a-concurrent-action)
in cats-effect site.

To prevent such data corruption we must use some concurrency control mechanism
that ensures that no stream will be closed while the `IO` returned by `transfer`
is being evaluated.  Cats-effect provides several constructs for controlling
concurrency, for this case we will use a
[_semaphore_](../concurrency/semaphore.md). A semaphore has a number of permits,
its method `.acquire` 'blocks' if no permit is available until `release` is
called on the same semaphore. It is important to remark that _there is no actual
thread being really blocked_, the thread that finds the `.acquire` call will be
immediately recycled by cats-effect. When the `release` method is invoked then
cats-effect will look for some available thread to resume the execution of the
code after `.acquire`.

We will use a semaphore with a single permit. The `.withPermit` method acquires
one permit, runs the `IO` given and then releases the permit.  We could also
use `.acquire` and then `.release` on the semaphore explicitly, but
`.withPermit` is more idiomatic and ensures that the permit is released even if
the effect run fails.

```scala
import cats.syntax.all._
import cats.effect.{Concurrent, IO, Resource}
import cats.effect.concurrent.Semaphore
import java.io._

// transfer and transmit methods as defined before
def transfer(origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream): IO[Long] = ???

def inputStream(f: File, guard: Semaphore[IO]): Resource[IO, FileInputStream] =
  Resource.make {
    IO(new FileInputStream(f))
  } { inStream => 
    guard.withPermit {
     IO(inStream.close()).handleErrorWith(_ => IO.unit)
    }
  }

def outputStream(f: File, guard: Semaphore[IO]): Resource[IO, FileOutputStream] =
  Resource.make {
    IO(new FileOutputStream(f))
  } { outStream =>
    guard.withPermit {
     IO(outStream.close()).handleErrorWith(_ => IO.unit)
    }
  }

def inputOutputStreams(in: File, out: File, guard: Semaphore[IO]): Resource[IO, (InputStream, OutputStream)] =
  for {
    inStream  <- inputStream(in, guard)
    outStream <- outputStream(out, guard)
  } yield (inStream, outStream)

def copy(origin: File, destination: File)(implicit concurrent: Concurrent[IO]): IO[Long] = {
  for {
    guard <- Semaphore[IO](1)
    count <- inputOutputStreams(origin, destination, guard).use { case (in, out) => 
               guard.withPermit(transfer(in, out))
             }
  } yield count
}
```

Before calling to `transfer` we acquire the semaphore, which is not released
until `transfer` is done. The `use` call ensures that the semaphore will be
released under any circumstances, whatever the result of `transfer` (success,
error, or cancellation). As the 'release' parts in the `Resource` instances are
now blocked on the same semaphore, we can be sure that streams are closed only
after `transfer` is over, _i.e._ we have implemented mutual exclusion of
`transfer` execution and resources releasing. An implicit `Concurrent` instance
is required to create the semaphore instance, which is included in the function
signature.

Mark that while the `IO` returned by `copy` is cancelable (because so are `IO`
instances returned by `Resource.use`), the `IO` returned by `transfer` is not.
Trying to cancel it will not have any effect and that `IO` will run until the
whole file is copied! In real world code you will probably want to make your
functions cancelable, section 
[Building cancelable IO tasks](../datatypes/io.md#building-cancelable-io-tasks) 
of `IO` documentation explains how to create such cancelable `IO` instances
(besides calling `Resource.use`, as we have done for our code).

And that is it! We are done, now we can create a program that uses this
`copy` function.

### `IOApp` for our final program

We will create a program that copies files, this program only takes two
parameters: the name of the origin and destination files. For coding this
program we will use [`IOApp`](../datatypes/ioapp.md) as it allows to maintain
purity in our definitions up to the program main function.

`IOApp` is a kind of 'functional' equivalent to Scala's `App`, where instead of
coding an effectful `main` method we code a pure `run` function. When executing
the class a `main` method defined in `IOApp` will call the `run` function we
have coded. Any interruption (like pressing `Ctrl-c`) will be treated as a
cancellation of the running `IO`. Also `IOApp` provides implicit instances of
`Timer[IO]` and `ContextShift[IO]` (not discussed yet in this tutorial).
`ContextShift[IO]` allows for having a `Concurrent[IO]` in scope, as the one
required by the `copy` function.

When coding `IOApp`, instead of a `main` function we have a `run` function,
which creates the `IO` instance that forms the program. In our case, our `run`
method can look like this:

```scala
import cats.effect._
import cats.syntax.all._
import java.io.File

object Main extends IOApp {

  // copy as defined before
  def copy(origin: File, destination: File): IO[Long] = ???

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
    for {
      _      <- if(args.length < 2) IO.raiseError(new IllegalArgumentException("Need origin and destination files"))
                else IO.unit
      orig = new File(args(0))
      dest = new File(args(1))
      count <- copy(orig, dest)
      _     <- IO(println(s"$count bytes copied from ${orig.getPath} to ${dest.getPath}"))
    } yield ExitCode.Success
}
```

Heed how `run` verifies the `args` list passed. If there are fewer than two
arguments, an error is raised. As `IO` implements `MonadError` we can at any
moment call to `IO.raiseError` to interrupt a sequence of `IO` operations.

#### Copy program code
You can check the [final version of our copy program
here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/copyfile/CopyFile.scala).

The program can be run from `sbt` just by issuing this call:

```scala
> runMain catseffecttutorial.CopyFile origin.txt destination.txt
```

It can be argued that using `IO{java.nio.file.Files.copy(...)}` would get an
`IO` with the same characteristics of purity as our function. But there is a
difference: our `IO` is safely cancelable! So the user can stop the running code
at any time for example by pressing `Ctrl-c`, our code will deal with safe
resource release (streams closing) even under such circumstances. The same will
apply if the `copy` function is run from other modules that require its
functionality. If the `IO` returned by this function is canceled while being
run, still resources will be properly released. But recall what we commented
before: this is because `use` returns `IO` instances that are cancelable, in
contrast our `transfer` function is not cancelable.

WARNING: To properly test cancelation, You should also ensure that
`fork := true` is set in the sbt configuration, otherwise sbt will
intercept the cancelation because it will be running the program
in the same JVM as itself.

### Polymorphic cats-effect code
There is an important characteristic of `IO` that we shall be aware of. `IO` is
able to encapsulate side-effects, but the capacity to define concurrent and/or
async and/or cancelable `IO` instances comes from the existence of a
`Concurrent[IO]` instance. [`Concurrent`](../typeclasses/concurrent.md) is a
type class that, for an `F[_]` carrying a side-effect, brings the ability to
cancel or start concurrently the side-effect in `F`. `Concurrent` also extends
type class [`Async`](../typeclasses/async.md), that allows to define
synchronous/asynchronous computations. `Async`, in turn, extends type class
[`Sync`](../typeclasses/sync.md), which can suspend the execution of side
effects in `F`.

So well, `Sync` can suspend side effects (and so can `Async` and `Concurrent` as
they extend `Sync`). We have used `IO` so far mostly for that purpose. Now,
going back to the code we created to copy files, could have we coded its
functions in terms of some `F[_]: Sync` instead of `IO`? Truth is we could and
**in fact it is recommendable** in real world programs.  See for example how we
would define a polymorphic version of our `transfer` function with this
approach, just by replacing any use of `IO` by calls to the `delay` and `pure`
methods of the `Sync[F[_]]` instance!

```scala
import cats.effect.Sync
import cats.syntax.all._
import java.io._

def transmit[F[_]: Sync](origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream, buffer: Array[Byte], acc: Long): F[Long] =
  for {
    amount <- Sync[F].delay(origin.read(buffer, 0, buffer.size))
    count  <- if(amount > -1) Sync[F].delay(destination.write(buffer, 0, amount)) >> transmit(origin, destination, buffer, acc + amount)
              else Sync[F].pure(acc) // End of read stream reached (by java.io.InputStream contract), nothing to write
  } yield count // Returns the actual amount of bytes transmitted
```

We can do the same transformation to most of the code we have created so far,
but not all. In `copy` you will find out that we do need a full instance of
`Concurrent[F]` in scope, this is because it is required by the `Semaphore`
instantiation:

```scala
import cats.effect._
import cats.effect.concurrent.Semaphore
import cats.syntax.all._
import java.io._

def transfer[F[_]: Sync](origin: InputStream, destination: OutputStream): F[Long] = ???
def inputOutputStreams[F[_]: Sync](in: File, out: File, guard: Semaphore[F]): Resource[F, (InputStream, OutputStream)] = ???

def copy[F[_]: Concurrent](origin: File, destination: File): F[Long] = 
  for {
    guard <- Semaphore[F](1)
    count <- inputOutputStreams(origin, destination, guard).use { case (in, out) => 
               guard.withPermit(transfer(in, out))
             }
  } yield count
```

Only in our `main` function we will set `IO` as the final `F` for
our program. To do so, of course, a `Concurrent[IO]` instance must be in scope,
but that instance is brought transparently by `IOApp` so we do not need to be
concerned about it.

During the remaining of this tutorial we will use polymorphic code, only falling
to `IO` in the `run` method of our `IOApp`s. Polymorphic code is less
restrictive, as functions are not tied to `IO` but are applicable to any `F[_]`
as long as there is an instance of the type class required (`Sync[F[_]]` ,
`Concurrent[F[_]]`...) in scope. The type class to use will depend on the
requirements of our code. For example, if the execution of the side-effect
should be cancelable, then we must stick to `Concurrent[F[_]]`. Also, it is
actually easier to work on `F` than on any specific type.

#### Copy program code, polymorphic version
The polymorphic version of our copy program in full is available
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/copyfile/CopyFilePolymorphic.scala).

### Exercises: improving our small `IO` program

To finalize we propose you some exercises that will help you to keep improving
your IO-kungfu:

1. Modify the `IOApp` so it shows an error and abort the execution if the origin
   and destination files are the same, the origin file cannot be open for
   reading or the destination file cannot be opened for writing. Also, if the
   destination file already exists, the program should ask for confirmation
   before overwriting that file.
2. Modify `transmit` so the buffer size is not hardcoded but passed as
   parameter.
3. Use some other concurrency tool of cats-effect instead of `semaphore` to
   ensure mutual exclusion of `transfer` execution and streams closing.
4. Create a new program able to copy folders. If the origin folder has
   subfolders, then their contents must be recursively copied too. Of course the
   copying must be safely cancelable at any moment.

## <a name="producerconsumer"></a>Producer-consumer problem - concurrency and fibers
The _producer-consumer_ pattern is often found in concurrent setups. Here one or
more producers insert data on a shared data structure like a queue or buffer
while one or more consumers extract data from it. Readers and writers run
concurrently. If the queue is empty then readers will block until data is
available, if the queue is full then writers will wait for some 'bucket' to be
free. Only one writer at a time can add data to the queue to prevent data
corruption. Also only one reader can extract data from the queue so no two
readers get the same data item.

Variations of this problem exists depending on whether there are more than one
consumer/producer, or whether the data structure siting between them is
size-bounded or not. Unless stated otherwise, the solutions discussed here are
suited for multi consumer and multi reader settings. Initially the solutions
will assume an unbounded data structure, to then present a solution for a
bounded one.

But before we work on the solution for this problem we must introduce _fibers_,
which are the basic building block of cats-effect concurrency.

### Intro to fibers
A fiber carries an `F` action to execute (typically an `IO` instance). Fibers
are like 'light' threads, meaning they can be used in a similar way than threads
to create concurrent code. However, they are _not_ threads. Spawning new fibers
does not guarantee that the action described in the `F` associated to it will be
run if there is a shortage of threads. Internally cats-effect uses thread pools
to run fibers. So if there is no thread available in the pool then the fiber
execution will 'wait' until some thread is free again. On the other hand fibers
are, unlike threads, very cheap entities. We can spawn millions of them at ease
without impacting the performance.

`ContextShift[F]` is in charge of assigning threads to the fibers waiting to be
run. When using `IOApp` we get also the `ContextShift[IO]` that we need to run
the fibers in our code.  But the developer can also create new `ContextShift[F]`
instances using custom thread pools.

Cats-effect implements some concurrency primitives to coordinate concurrent
fibers: [Deferred](../concurrency/deferred.md),
[MVar2](../concurrency/mvar.md),
[Ref](../concurrency/ref.md) and
[Semaphore](../concurrency/semaphore.md)
(semaphores we already discussed in the first part of this tutorial). It is
important to understand that, when a fiber gets blocked by some concurrent data
structure, cats-effect recycles the thread so it becomes available for other
fibers. Cats-effect also recovers threads of finished and cancelled fibers.  But
keep in mind that, in contrast, if the fiber is blocked by some external action
like waiting for some input from a TCP socket, then cats-effect has no way to
recover back that thread until the action finishes.

Way more detailed info about concurrency in cats-effect can be found in [this
other tutorial 'Concurrency in Scala with
Cats-Effect'](https://github.com/slouc/concurrency-in-scala-with-ce). It is also
strongly advised to read the 
[Concurrency section of cats-effect docs](../concurrency/index.md). But for the
remaining of this tutorial we will focus on a practical approach to those
concepts.

Ok, now we have briefly discussed fibers we can start working on our
producer-consumer problem.

### First (and inefficient) implementation
We need an intermediate structure where producer(s) can insert data to and
consumer(s) extracts data from. Let's assume a simple queue. Initially there
will be only one producer and one consumer. Producer will generate a sequence of
integers (`1`, `2`, `3`...), consumer will just read that sequence.  Our shared
queue will be an instance of an immutable `Queue[Int]`.

As accesses to the queue can (and will!) be concurrent, we need some way to
protect the queue so only one fiber at a time is handling it. The best way to
ensure an ordered access to some shared data is 
[Ref](../concurrency/ref.md). A `Ref` instance
wraps some given data and implements methods to manipulate that data in a safe
manner. When some fiber is runnning one of those methods, any other call to any
method of the `Ref` instance will be blocked.

The `Ref` wrapping our queue will be `Ref[F, Queue[Int]]` (for some `F[_]`).

Now, our `producer` method will be:

```scala
import cats.effect._
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
import cats.syntax.all._
import collection.immutable.Queue

def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counter: Int): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    _ <- if(counter % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Produced $counter items")) else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- queueR.getAndUpdate(_.enqueue(counter + 1)) // Putting data in shared queue
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield ()) >> producer(queueR, counter + 1)
```

First line just prints some log message every `10000` items, so we know if it is
'alive'. Then it calls `queueR.getAndUpdate` to add data into the queue. Note
that `.getAndUpdate` provides the current queue, then we use `.enqueue` to
insert the next value `counter+1`. This call returns a new queue with the value
added that is stored by the ref instance. If some other fiber is accessing to
`queueR` then the fiber is blocked.

Finally we run `ContextShift[F].shift` before calling again to the producer
recursively with the next counter value. In fact, the call to `.shift` is not
strictly needed but it is a good policy to include it in recursive functions.
Why is that? Well, internally cats-effect tries to assign fibers so all tasks
are given the chance to be executed. But in a recursive function that
potentially never ends it can be that the fiber is always running and
cats-effect has no change to recover the thread being used by it. By calling to
`.shift` the programmer explicitly tells cats-effect that the current thread
can be re-assigned to other fiber if so decides. Strictly speaking, maybe our
`producer` does not need such call as the access to `queueR.getAndUpdate` will
get the fiber blocked if some other fiber is using `queueR` at that moment, and
cats-effect can recycle blocked fibers for other tasks. Still, we keep it there
as good practice.

The `consumer` method is a bit different. It will try to read data from the
queue but it must be aware that the queue must be empty:

```scala
import cats.effect._
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
import cats.syntax.all._
import collection.immutable.Queue

def consumer[F[_] : Sync: ContextShift](queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]]): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    iO <- queueR.modify{ queue =>
      queue.dequeueOption.fold((queue, Option.empty[Int])){case (i,queue) => (queue, Option(i))}
    }
    _ <- if(iO.exists(_ % 10000 == 0)) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Consumed ${iO.get} items"))
      else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield iO) >> consumer(queueR)
```

The call to `queueR.modify` allows to modify the wrapped data (our queue) and
return a value that is computed from that data. In our case, it returns an
`Option[Int]` that will be `None` if queue was empty. Next line is used to log
a message in console every `10000` read items. Finally `consumer` is called
recursively to start again.

We can now create a program that instantiates our `queueR` and runs both
`producer` and `consumer` in parallel:

```scala
import cats.effect._
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
import cats.syntax.all._
import collection.immutable.Queue

object InefficientProducerConsumer extends IOApp {

  def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counter: Int): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before
  def consumer[F[_] : Sync: ContextShift](queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]]): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
    for {
      queueR <- Ref.of[IO, Queue[Int]](Queue.empty[Int])
      res <- (consumer(queueR), producer(queueR, 0))
        .parMapN((_, _) => ExitCode.Success) // Run producer and consumer in parallel until done (likely by user cancelling with CTRL-C)
        .handleErrorWith { t =>
          IO(println(s"Error caught: ${t.getMessage}")).as(ExitCode.Error)
        }
    } yield res

}
```

The full implementation of this naive producer consumer is available
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/producerconsumer/InefficientProducerConsumer.scala).

Our `run` function instantiates the shared queue wrapped in a `Ref` and boots
the producer and consumer in parallel. To do to it uses `parMapN`, that creates
and runs the fibers that will run the `IO`s passed as paremeter. Then it takes
the output of each fiber and and applies a given function to them. In our case
both producer and consumer shall run forever until user presses CTRL-C which
will trigger a cancellation.

Alternatively we could have used `start` method to explicitely create new
`Fiber` instances that will run the producer and consumer, then use `join` to
wait for them to finish, something like:

```scala
def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
  for {
    queueR <- Ref.of[IO, Queue[Int]](Queue.empty[Int])
    producerFiber <- producer(queueR, 0).start
    consumerFiber <- consumer(queueR, 0).start
    _ <- producerFiber.join
    _ <- consumerFiber.join
  } yield ExitCode.Error
```

Problem is, if there is an error in any of the fibers the `join` call will not
hint it, nor it will return. In contrast `parMapN` does promote the error it
finds to the caller. _In general, if possible, programmers should prefer to use
higher level commands such as `parMapN` or `parSequence` to deal with fibers_.

Ok, we stick to our implementation based on `.parMapN`. Are we done? Does it
Work? Well, it works... but it is far from ideal. If we run it we will find that
the producer runs faster than the consumer so the queue is constantly growing.
And, even if that was not the case, we must realize that the consumer will be
continually running regardless if there are elements in the queue, which is far
from ideal. We will try to improve it in the next section using _semaphores_.
Also we will use several consumers and producers to balance production and
consumption rate.

### Bringing in semaphores
As discussed in the first section of this tutorial, semaphores are used to
control access to critical sections of our code that handle shared resources,
when those sections can be run concurrently. Each semaphore contains a number
that represents _permits_. To access a critical section permits have to be
obtained, later to be released when the critical section is left.

In our producer/consumer code we already protect access to the queue (our shared
resource) using a `Ref`. But we can use semaphores on top of that to signal
whether there are elements in the queue or not. This can be done by keeping in
the semaphore a counter of `filled` buckets, which will be increased when adding
elements to the queue, and decreased when elements are removed. Consumer code
will be changed so it blocks when there are no elements to be retrieved
(`filled` has zero permits).

So now our producer and consumer look like this:

```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.{Ref, Semaphore}
import cats.effect._
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.collection.immutable.Queue

def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counterR: Ref[F, Int], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    i <- counterR.getAndUpdate(_ + 1)
    _ <- queueR.getAndUpdate(_.enqueue(i))
    _ <- filled.release // Signal new item in queue
    _ <- if(i % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Producer $id has reached $i items")) else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield ()) >> producer(id, queueR, counterR, filled)

def consumer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    _ <- filled.acquire // Wait for some item in queue
    i <- queueR.modify(_.dequeue.swap)
    _ <- if(i % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Consumer $id has reached $i items")) else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield ()) >> consumer(id, queueR, filled)
```

Note how the producer uses `filled.release` to signal that a new item is
available in the queue by increasing the number of permits in the semaphore.
Likewise, consumer uses `filled.acquire` which block if `filled` is zero (no
elements in queue). If it is not zero (or as soon as it becomes > 0) the call is
unblocked and the number of permits in the semaphore is decreased. Now our consumer
is not concerned about trying to read from an empty queue. If it got a 'permit'
from the semaphore it means the queue will have an element the consumer can
read.

Finally we modify our main program so it instantiates the counter and queue
references, alongside with the semaphore. Also it will create several consumers
and producers, 10 of each, and will start all of them in parallel:

```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.{Ref, Semaphore}
import cats.effect._
import cats.instances.list._
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.collection.immutable.Queue

object ProducerConsumer extends IOApp {

  def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counterR: Ref[F, Int], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before

  def consumer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
    for {
      queueR <- Ref.of[IO, Queue[Int]](Queue.empty[Int])
      counterR <- Ref.of[IO, Int](1)
      filled <- Semaphore[IO](0)
      producers = List.range(1, 11).map(producer(_, queueR, counterR, filled)) // 10 producers
      consumers = List.range(1, 11).map(consumer(_, queueR, filled))           // 10 consumers
      res <- (producers ++ consumers)
        .parSequence.as(ExitCode.Success) // Run producers and consumers in parallel until done (likely by user cancelling with CTRL-C)
        .handleErrorWith { t =>
          IO(println(s"Error caught: ${t.getMessage}")).as(ExitCode.Error)
        }
    } yield res
}
```

The full implementation of this producer consumer with unbounded queue is available
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/producerconsumer/ProducerConsumer.scala).

Producers and consumers are created as two list of `IO` instances. All of them
are started in their own fiber by the call to `parSequence`, which will wait for
all of them to finish and then return the value passed as parameter. As in the
previous example it shall run forever until the user presses CTRL-C.

Having several consumers and producers improves the balance between consumers
and producers... but still, on the long run, queue tends to grow in size. To
fix this we will ensure the size of the queue is bounded, so whenever that max
size is reached producers will block as they consumers do when the queue is
empty.

### Producer consumer with bounded queue
We will use another semaphore `empty` to represent the amount of empty 'buckets'
in the queue. It will mirror the behavior of `filled`. When a new item is
enqueued a call to `empty.release` will signal that there is a new empty bucket
in the queue. Likewise, the producers will request an empty bucket by calling
`empty.acquire` prior to add new elements, blocking when `empty` number of
permits is zero.

Producer and consumer code now becomes:

```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.{Ref, Semaphore}
import cats.effect._
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.collection.immutable.Queue

def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counterR: Ref[F, Int], empty: Semaphore[F], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    i <- counterR.getAndUpdate(_ + 1)
    _ <- empty.acquire  // Wait for some bucket free in queue
    _ <- queueR.getAndUpdate(_.enqueue(i))
    _ <- filled.release // Signal new item in queue
    _ <- if(i % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Producer $id has reached $i items")) else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield ()) >> producer(id, queueR, counterR, empty, filled)

def consumer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], empty: Semaphore[F], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] =
  (for {
    _ <- filled.acquire // Wait for some item in queue
    i <- queueR.modify(_.dequeue.swap)
    _ <- empty.release  // Signal new bucket free in queue
    _ <- if(i % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Consumer $id has reached $i items")) else Sync[F].unit
    _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
  } yield ()) >> consumer(id, queueR, empty, filled)
```

The main program is almost the same, we only add the creation of the `empty`
semaphore setting as value the max size of the queue. So for a max size of `100`
we would have:

```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.{Ref, Semaphore}
import cats.effect._
import cats.instances.list._
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.collection.immutable.Queue

object ProducerConsumerBounded extends IOApp {

  def producer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], counterR: Ref[F, Int], empty: Semaphore[F], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before

  def consumer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], empty: Semaphore[F], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] = ??? // As defined before

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
    for {
      queueR <- Ref.of[IO, Queue[Int]](Queue.empty[Int])
      counterR <- Ref.of[IO, Int](1)
      empty <- Semaphore[IO](100)
      filled <- Semaphore[IO](0)
      producers = List.range(1, 11).map(producer(_, queueR, counterR, empty, filled)) // 10 producers
      consumers = List.range(1, 11).map(consumer(_, queueR, empty, filled))           // 10 consumers
      res <- (producers ++ consumers)
        .parSequence.as(ExitCode.Success) // Run producers and consumers in parallel until done (likely by user cancelling with CTRL-C)
        .handleErrorWith { t =>
          IO(println(s"Error caught: ${t.getMessage}")).as(ExitCode.Error)
        }
    } yield res
}
```

The full implementation of this producer consumer with bounded queue is available
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/producerconsumer/ProducerConsumerBounded.scala).

### On cancellation of producer and consumers
In our producers/consumers code we have not dealt yet with cancellation. Truth
is the only cancellation that can happen in those small programs is caused by
the user 'killing' the main program, and in that case we are not much concerned
about the consequences (the program has terminated after all). But in more
complex settings we have to be careful as consumers and producers fibers can be
cancelled at any time. And which will then be the consequences? Well, basically
we would not be able to trust our semaphores to represent the amount of items
and free buckets in the queue. See for example the code of a consumer in our
bounded queue setting. It must make sure that whenever a `filled` permit is
acquired then a) a new element is added and b) `empty.release` is called. A
cancellation right before those actions will leave the semaphores with values
that do not represent the internal state of the queue.

To prevent this we must make sure that a call to a producer and a consumer is
fully run without being cancelled. This can be done with `Sync[F].uncancelable`,
which ensures that the `F` instance passed as parameter cannot be cancelled. So,
for example, our consumer in the bounded queue example will look like:

```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.{Ref, Semaphore}
import cats.effect.{ContextShift, ExitCode, IO, IOApp, Sync}
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.collection.immutable.Queue

def consumer[F[_]: Sync: ContextShift](id: Int, queueR: Ref[F, Queue[Int]], empty: Semaphore[F], filled: Semaphore[F]): F[Unit] =
  Sync[F].uncancelable(
    for {
      _ <- filled.acquire // Wait for some item in queue
      i <- queueR.modify(_.dequeue.swap)
      _ <- empty.release
      _ <- if(i % 10000 == 0) Sync[F].delay(println(s"Consumer $id has reached $i items")) else Sync[F].unit
      _ <- ContextShift[F].shift
    } yield ()
  ) >> consumer(id, queueR, empty, filled)
```

Making the `producer` function uncancelable is similar, we leave that as a small
exercise.


### Exercise: build a concurrent queue
A _concurrent queue_ is, well, a queue data structure that allows safe
concurrent access. That is, several concurrent processes can safely add and
retrieve data from the queue. It is easy to realize that during the previous
sections we already implemented that kind of functionality, it was
embedded in our `producer` and `consumer` functions. To build a concurrent queue
we only need to extract from those methods the part that handles the concurrent
access.

A simple concurrent queue with only two methods could be defined as:

```scala
import cats.effect.{Concurrent, Sync}

trait SimpleConcurrentQueue[F[_], A] {
  /** Get and remove first element from queue, blocks if queue empty. */
  def poll: F[A]
  /** Put element at then end of queue, blocks if queue is bounded and full.*/
  def put(a: A): F[Unit]
}

// Exercise: implement builder methods in this companion object
object SimpleConcurrentQueue {
  def unbounded[F[_]: Concurrent: Sync, A]: F[SimpleConcurrentQueue[F, A]] = ???
  def bounded[F[_]: Concurrent: Sync, A](size: Int): F[SimpleConcurrentQueue[F, A]] = ???
}
```

The exercise is to implement the missing constructor methods we have included in
`SimpleConcurrentQueue` companion object. A possible implementation is given
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/producerconsumer/exerciseconcurrentqueue/SimpleConcurrentQueue.scala) for reference.

Finally, we propose you to write a more complete concurrent queue
implementation with these definitions:

```scala
import cats.effect.{Concurrent, Sync}

trait ConcurrentQueue[F[_], A] {
  /** Get and remove first element from queue, blocks if queue empty. */
  def poll: F[A]
  /** Get and remove first `n` elements from queue, blocks if less than `n` items are available in queue.
   * Error raised if `n < 0` or, in bounded queues, if `n > max size of queue`.*/
  def pollN(n: Int): F[List[A]]
  /** Get, but not remove, first element in queue, blocks if queue empty. */
  def peek: F[A]
  /** Get, but not remove, first `n` elements in queue, blocks if less than `n` items are available in queue.
   * Error raised if `n < 0` or, in bounded queues, if `n > max size of queue`.*/
  def peekN(n: Int): F[List[A]]
  /** Put element at then end of queue, blocks if queue is bounded and full. */
  def put(a: A): F[Unit]
  /** Puts elements at the end of the queue, blocks if queue is bounded and does not have spare size for all items.
   * Error raised in bounded queues if `as.size > max size of queue`.*/
  def putN(as: List[A]): F[Unit]
  /** Try to get and remove first element from queue, immediately returning `F[None]` if queue empty. Non-blocking. */
  def tryPoll: F[Option[A]]
  /** Try to get and remove first `n` elements from queue, immediately returning `F[None]` if less than `n` items are available in queue. Non-blocking.
   * Error raised if n < 0. */
  def tryPollN(n: Int): F[Option[List[A]]]
  /** Try to get, but not remove, first element from queue, immediately returning `F[None]` if queue empty. Non-blocking. */
  def tryPeek: F[Option[A]]
  /** Try to get, but not remove, first  `n` elements from queue, immediately returning `F[None]` if less than `n` items are available in queue. Non-blocking.
   * Error raised if n < 0. */
  def tryPeekN(n: Int): F[Option[List[A]]]
  /** Try to put element at the end of queue, immediately returning `F[false]` if queue is bounded and full. Non-blocking. */
  def tryPut(a: A): F[Boolean]
  /** Try to put elements in list at the end of queue, immediately returning `F[false]` if queue is bounded and does not have spare size for all items. Non-blocking. */
  def tryPutN(as: List[A]): F[Boolean]
  /** Returns # of items in queue. Non-blocking. */
  def size: F[Long]
  /** Returns `F[true]` if queue empty, `F[false]` otherwise. Non-blocking. */
  def isEmpty: F[Boolean]
}

/**
 * Specific methods for bounded concurrent queues.
 */
trait BoundedConcurrentQueue[F[_], A] extends ConcurrentQueue [F, A] {
  /** Max queue size. */
  val maxQueueSize: Int
  /** Remaining empty buckets. Non-blocking.*/
  def emptyBuckets: F[Long]
  /** Returns `F[true]` if queue full, `F[false]` otherwise. Non-blocking. */
  def isFull: F[Boolean]
}

// Exercise: implement builder methods in this companion object
object ConcurrentQueue {
  def unbounded[F[_]: Concurrent: Sync, A]: F[ConcurrentQueue[F, A]] = ???
  def bounded[F[_]: Concurrent: Sync, A](size: Int): F[BoundedConcurrentQueue[F, A]] = ???
}
```

Note that now bounded concurrent queues have their own type
`BoundedConcurrentQueue` which extends `ConcurrentQueue` with some functions
specific to them. As before, you should try to implement the builder methods in
companion object `ConcurrentQueue`. **TIP**: we have not reviewed all methods
that cats-effect's `Semaphore` has to offer. Take a look to `Semaphore`
[API](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/cats/effect/concurrent/Semaphore.html)
as you will find some new useful methods there.


A possible implementation of the concurrent queue is given
[here](https://github.com/lrodero/cats-effect-tutorial/blob/replace_tcp_section_with_prodcons/src/main/scala/catseffecttutorial/producerconsumer/exerciseconcurrentqueue/ConcurrentQueue.scala)
for reference. **NOTE** this concurrent queue implementation is not intended for
high-throughput requirements, and it has not been tested in production
environments.  For a production-ready, high-performance concurrent queue it is
strongly advised to consider [Monix's concurrent
queue](https://monix.io/api/current/monix/catnap/ConcurrentQueue.html), which is
cats-effect compatible.

## Conclusion

With all this we have covered a good deal of what cats-effect has to offer (but
not all!). Now you are ready to use to create code that operate side effects in
a purely functional manner. Enjoy the ride!
