/**
 * A stopgap solution until upstream dependencies (cats, cats-laws and discipline-munit for dotty Scala.js) are
 * officially released for dotty (without resorting to `withDottyCompat`). Currently, `cats-effect` transitively depends
 * on a compat version of `munit` (even though it is directly released for dotty) and because of that, the correct
 * dotty macro cannot be inferred that injects `munit.Location` instances into assertions. When all dependencies are
 * released for dotty, this trait can be dropped outright and test classes can depend directly on `munit.FunSuite` or
 * `munit.DisciplineSuite`, as needed.
